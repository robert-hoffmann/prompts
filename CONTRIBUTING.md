# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Before submitting a contribution, please read these guidelines carefully.

## Core Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity** – Only contribute if it genuinely adds value or fixes an existing issue.
2. **Clean and Concise** – All additions and modifications must be clear, well-written, and to the point.
3. **No Bloat** – Prompt files must **never exceed 500 lines**. If a file is approaching this limit, consider refactoring or splitting content.

## What We Accept

- **Bug fixes** – Corrections to errors, typos, or broken logic
- **Improved wording** – Better phrasing that reinforces existing rules or improves clarity
- **Consolidation** – Merging redundant or overlapping instructions
- **New instructions** – Only if they address a clear gap and provide measurable value

## What We Don't Accept

- Redundant or duplicate content
- Overly verbose explanations when concise wording suffices
- Changes that significantly increase file size without proportional value
- Stylistic changes that don't improve clarity or function

## Before You Contribute

1. **Check existing content** – Ensure your contribution doesn't duplicate what's already there.
2. **Verify the value** – Ask yourself: "Does this fix something or add clear value?"
3. **Keep it concise** – If you can say it in fewer words, do so.
4. **Respect the line limit** – Ensure your changes won't push any file beyond 500 lines.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-change`)
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above
4. Verify file lengths: no prompt file should exceed 500 lines
5. Write a clear, descriptive commit message
6. Submit a pull request with:
   - A concise description of what you changed
   - **Why** the change adds value or fixes an issue
   - Confirmation that you've checked the line count

## Code Review Criteria

Pull requests will be evaluated on:

- [ ] Does it add value or fix an issue?
- [ ] Is the wording clean and concise?
- [ ] Does it stay within the 500-line limit?
- [ ] Does it reinforce rather than contradict existing rules?
- [ ] Is it free of redundancy?

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your contribution fits these guidelines, open an issue first to discuss it.

*Remember: Less is more. A well-crafted, concise instruction is worth more than pages of verbose explanation.*
